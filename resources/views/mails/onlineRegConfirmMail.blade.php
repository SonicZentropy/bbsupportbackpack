    Greetings {{ $name }}:

You are receiving this email because your online Blackboard Basics Certification training is now available. From the date that you are provided access to this course, you will be allotted 60 days to complete ALL course requirements. After 60 days, any training progress will be lost. Your training access dates are: June 1, 2017 â€“ August 1, 2017.

Blackboard Training Server
The Blackboard training takes places in a Blackboard training server. This will be different from the typical way you may access Blackboard using MyPTCPortal. You will need to visit training.pulaskitech.blackboard.com. You will log in using your UA-PTC employee ID and the password Letmein123. All of your training will take places in this server. Once logged in, you will find a course syllabus containing all of the information that you need to succeed in this course. Below you will find the essentials to get you started.

Course Shells
Once logged into the training server, you should have access to two courses. The first course titled BBTRAIN.BASICS.ONLINE is the course you be taking as a student. You will walk through all of the content in this course. The second course titled BBTRAIN.O.2017.MM.00# - Your.Name is the course you will be building as an instructor. This course is you development shell (dev shell). You will toggle between these two course shells as you complete your training.

Final
Once you have completed ALL course assignments, you will need to email OFS@pulaskitech.edu to request a "BB training course final dev shell." Be sure to mention Blackboard training in your request as we receive various requests through this email address. You will receive a confirmation email that your request has been received, and a second email once your final dev shell has been created.

Help
If you have any trouble logging into the system or accessing your course shells, please email OFS@pulaskitech.edu. You will be notified if, for any reason, it is expected that either Blackboard server will be done. Please understand there will be no deadline extensions allowed.

Best of luck on completing your certification,
UA-PTC Blackboard Support Team
